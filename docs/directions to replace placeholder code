 Below is a completely plain text breakdown of every file and all the placeholder values that must be replaced for your USDC–SHIB–wUSD Bridge system to work properly with BONE and TREAT integration.

⸻

	1.	FILE: /bridge-node/config/node.config.json
REPLACE THESE:

	•	“ethRpc”: “https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/YOUR_INFURA_KEY”
→ Replace YOUR_INFURA_KEY with your actual Ethereum RPC URL from Infura, Alchemy, or other provider.
	•	“privateKeyPath”: “./keys/node-private-key.pem”
→ Ensure this path leads to a real file containing your node’s private key.
	•	“wusdContractAddress”: “0xYourWUSDContractAddressHere”
→ Replace with the actual deployed address of your wUSD contract.
	•	“boneTokenAddress”: “0xYourBONEERC20TokenAddress”
→ Replace with the deployed ERC-20 BONE token address.
	•	“treatTokenAddress”: “0xYourTREATERC20TokenAddress”
→ Replace with the deployed ERC-20 TREAT token address.
	•	“boneBridgeAddress”: “0xYourBONEBridgeContractAddress”
→ Replace with the deployed address of your BONEBridge contract.
	•	“treatBridgeAddress”: “0xYourTREATBridgeContractAddress”
→ Replace with the deployed address of your TREATBridge contract.
	•	“quorumNodes”: [“0xNode1PublicKeyOrAddress”, “0xNode2PublicKeyOrAddress”, …]
→ Replace with the actual Ethereum addresses or public keys of the nodes participating in quorum.

⸻

	2.	FILE: /frontend/src/components/BridgeForm.js
REPLACE THESE:

Inside tokenOptions:
	•	USDC: “0xYourUSDCBridgeAddress”
→ Replace with the address of your deployed USDC bridge contract.
	•	SHIB: “0xYourSHIBBridgeAddress”
→ Replace with the address of your deployed SHIB bridge contract.
	•	DOGE: “0xYourDOGEBridgeAddress”
→ Replace with DOGE relayer destination if applicable.
	•	BONE: “0xYourBONEBridgeAddress”
→ Replace with your BONEBridge contract address.
	•	TREAT: “0xYourTREATBridgeAddress”
→ Replace with your TREATBridge contract address.

Also ensure the ABI being imported:
	•	import ABI from ‘../abis/BridgeABI.json’
→ Must contain the correct ABI for your BONEBridge and TREATBridge contracts.

⸻

	3.	FILE: /bridge-node/core/executor.js
REPLACE THESE:

	•	const treatAbi = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync(’./abis/TREATToken.json’, ‘utf8’))
→ Make sure this file exists and contains the actual ABI of your TREAT token (must include the mint function).
	•	config.treatTokenAddress
→ Must be a real deployed TREAT token address, defined in node.config.json.
	•	const reward = ethers.parseUnits(“0.001”, 18)
→ Optional: adjust the TREAT reward amount as desired.

⸻

	4.	FILE: /bridge-node/scripts/start-node.js
REPLACE AND ENSURE:

	•	const config = require(’../config/node.config.json’)
→ Ensure config values like ethRpc, privateKeyPath, and contract addresses are correctly defined and resolvable.
	•	const privateKey = fs.readFileSync(config.privateKeyPath, ‘utf8’).trim()
→ Make sure the file at this path exists and contains a real private key in PEM or raw hex format.
	•	simulateIncomingMint()
→ In production, replace this with a real event listener that detects bridge events.

⸻

	5.	FILE: /bridge-node/utils/validateConfig.js
ENSURE:

	•	All fields mentioned above are present in node.config.json
	•	Each Ethereum address begins with “0x” and is 42 characters long
	•	quorumNodes array contains enough entries to meet minSignaturesRequired

⸻

	6.	FILE: /bridge-node/keys/node-private-key.pem
ENSURE:

	•	This file contains a valid private key for an Ethereum wallet
	•	It is used by the node runner to sign mint and reward transactions

⸻

	7.	FILE: /frontend/src/abis/BridgeABI.json
ENSURE:

	•	This ABI file matches the ABI of the BONEBridge and TREATBridge contracts
	•	Must include the function depositAndMint(uint256)

⸻

	8.	FILE: /abis/TREATToken.json
ENSURE:

	•	Contains the ABI for your TREAT token contract
	•	Must include the function mint(address,uint256)

⸻

	9.	FILE: /README.md
REPLACE PLACEHOLDERS:

	•	Update any example addresses, tokens, or chains mentioned in the README with your actual deployment info
	•	Add real project status, usage instructions, or endpoints

⸻

	10.	FILES: /contracts/BONEBridge.sol and /contracts/TREATBridge.sol
ENSURE:

	•	Constructor parameters (boneToken, treatToken, wUSD) are passed the correct deployed addresses
	•	OnlyOwner functions like setConversionRate are controlled securely
	•	Token decimals match actual deployed token standards (usually 18)
