# White Paper: USDC–SHIB–wUSD Bridge with BONE and TREAT Integration

## 1. Executive Summary
The USDC–SHIB–wUSD Bridge is a decentralized cross-chain protocol that enables users to convert between major ecosystem tokens—USDC, SHIB, BONE, TREAT, and DOGE—and a wrapped stablecoin, wUSD. The bridge supports Ethereum, BSC, Solana, XRP, and Dogecoin networks, and now features enhanced utility via BONE and TREAT token integration.

## 2. Objectives
- Enable seamless value transfer across EVM and non-EVM chains.
- Support SHIB ecosystem tokens (SHIB, BONE, TREAT) within a stablecoin bridge.
- Provide validator incentives through TREAT minting.
- Introduce governance and quorum control via BONE staking.

## 3. System Architecture
### Chains Supported:
- Ethereum: Core contracts (USDC, SHIB, BONE, TREAT, wUSD)
- BSC: USDC, SHIB mirrored contracts
- Solana: Rust-based SPL wUSD
- XRP: Off-chain listener with on-chain mint
- Dogecoin: UTXO tracker with relayer mint logic

### Components:
- Smart Contracts: wUSD, BONEBridge, TREATBridge, wrapped token standards
- Frontend: React UI with token selection (USDC, SHIB, BONE, TREAT)
- Bridge Node: Validator with quorum-based mint execution and TREAT rewards
- Relayers: Handle non-EVM events and route to EVM bridge

## 4. BONE Integration
BONE serves dual roles:
- Bridgeable asset via BONEBridge.sol (mint wUSD)
- Validator staking token to influence node voting weight and DAO proposals

## 5. TREAT Integration
TREAT is:
- Bridgeable asset via TREATBridge.sol (mint wUSD)
- Reward token issued to node runners on each successful mint

## 6. Token Conversion Logic
Each bridge contract uses a conversion rate:
- BONE to USD = configurable (e.g., 0.01 USD per BONE)
- TREAT to USD = configurable (e.g., 0.005 USD per TREAT)
Rates may use Chainlink or manual pricing.

## 7. Security
- Uses OpenZeppelin Ownable and IERC20 standards
- Validator logic uses quorum multisig threshold in node.config.json
- Rate updates restricted to contract owner (DAO migration planned)
- Private key security via local PEM file

## 8. Governance
- BONE will power DAO governance (via OpenZeppelin Governor or Snapshot)
- Parameters: bridge fees, supported tokens, validator onboarding

## 9. Deployment Overview
1. Deploy wUSD token
2. Deploy BONEBridge and TREATBridge
3. Configure node.config.json with addresses and quorum settings
4. Deploy relayer listeners for DOGE and XRP
5. Launch validator node with status and reward logic

## 10. Future Improvements
- Real-time price feeds for all tokens
- wBONE and wTREAT optional wrappers
- Mobile-first frontend UI and hardware wallet integration
- DAO ownership transfer
