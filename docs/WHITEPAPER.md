# The White Papers 2: Decentralized Token Bridging with wUSD

## Abstract

This white paper outlines a modular cross-chain bridge architecture enabling users to convert USDC into SHIB and then mint a stablecoin proxy, Wrapped USD (wUSD), for real-world payment integration. The bridge supports token swaps, mint/burn mechanics, and cross-chain interoperability through messaging relayers and DEX routing.

## Core Components

- **Wrapped USD (wUSD):** ERC-20 token backed by USDC/SHIB liquidity.
- **USDC-to-SHIB Bridge:** Smart contract that facilitates USDC deposits, swaps to SHIB, and mints wUSD.
- **DEX Integration:** Interfaces with Uniswap, PancakeSwap, and Solana-native AMMs.
- **Cross-Chain Bridges:** Connects to Solana, BSC, XRP, and Dogecoin using relayers and off-chain oracles.
- **Debit Card Layer:** Enables real-world spending via fiat conversion of wUSD via processors.

## Supported Chains

- Ethereum (USDC, SHIB, wUSD)
- BSC (wUSD mint/burn via bridge relay)
- Solana (Rust-based bridge and token instruction parsing)
- XRP (event-based minting via external ledger integration)
- Dogecoin (BTC-style UTXO locking + event-based mint relay)

## Roadmap

- Phase 1: Ethereum/USDC/SHIB/wUSD integration
- Phase 2: BSC + Solana cross-chain support
- Phase 3: XRP + DOGE message ingestion
- Phase 4: Debit card processor and DAO reward staking
