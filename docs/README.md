# ðŸª™ USDCâ€“SHIBâ€“wUSD Bridge (Multi-Chain)

## Overview

This repository contains a full-stack implementation of a decentralized bridge allowing USDC-to-SHIB conversion with stablecoin wrapping into `wUSD`, plus support for multi-chain mint/burn events and debit card interoperability.

## Chain Support

- **Ethereum** â€“ USDC, SHIB, wUSD (core contracts)
- **BSC** â€“ Mirror of Ethereum contracts
- **Solana** â€“ Rust-based token program
- **XRP** â€“ Off-chain event listener integration
- **Dogecoin** â€“ UTXO-based relayer minting

## Key Components

- `contracts/` â€“ Solidity + Rust smart contracts
- `scripts/` â€“ Deployment and interaction scripts
- `services/` â€“ Relayers, messaging, and event ingestion
- `frontend/` â€“ React dApp for user interaction
- `docs/` â€“ Technical whitepapers and integration guides

## Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tripamillion420/usdc-shib-bridge-wusd.git
cd usdc-shib-bridge-wusd
npm install
npx hardhat compile
